# BLA_Application_2

Project for Big League Advance Internship Application

-- OBJECTIVE -- The objective of this project is to model pick probabilities in the NBA Draft Lottery (Lottery process is explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery#Process). We are interested in modeling these probablities for three major variables:

  1. Total number of teams participating in the draft lottery process (ex. 14 in the 2018 draft)
  2. First pick odds for each of the teams
  3. Number of lottery picks available (ex. 3 in the 2018 draft)
  
The solution, coded in C++ and using basic standard libary methods, is flexible to all three variables.


-- PROJECT PARTS -- 

  1. "Odds_Table" contains all code
  2. "results" contains csv files representing the calculated probabilities for several given draft scenarios
  3. "details.md" describes the statistical and programming approach, as well as runtime/space analysis 
  4. ".idea", "cmake_build_debug", and "CMakeLists.txt" are default C++ and Github folders. These can be safely ignored
  
  
  
Enjoy!
